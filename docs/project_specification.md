**Focus: elegance, subtle credit assignment**

**one-line: (**showcase \+) substack for interface-recipes

As AI advances get cheaper, faster and ubiquitous, we expect the standard “chat” interface — where AI inference is limited to the scale and speed of a single human — will be replaced with a Cambrian explosion of AI-based tools.

Two things ubiquitous AI will be able to soon do well:

1. Empower **individuals:** Reproduce any digital interface with very little needed information (let alone code), tailored to the user.
2. Enable **collaboration:** Process large-scale information enabling mass collaboration, tapping into the power of collectives (a la [pol.is](http://pol.is))

Combining these two ingredients, we aim to build a substack-like platform that will connect tool designers and users:

1. Designers **upload DIY tool *recipes*** (sketches, prompts, code, data, etc).
2. Users’ AI **cooks** these recipes into their own, ***individualized*** tools.
3. Users **subscribe** to designers they like.
4. Experts **curate** them for **safety-focus** and ***collaborativeness***.
5. We sell **courses** to teach our ***decentralized*** **design philosophy**.

The platform will primarily cater to tools built with a specific in-house design philosophy for decentralized intelligence which backgrounds AI as infrastructure and foregrounds human meaning. This includes a new kind of collaborative+adaptive approach to autoformalization, which we expect will be relevant to tricky AI safety concepts that resist abstraction (eg. “deception”, “agency”, “value”, “power-seeking”)
