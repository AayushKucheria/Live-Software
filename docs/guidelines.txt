Make sure to: 
Create a presentation that assumes zero context on the design philosophy from the audience. Introduces any thing you're using (eg. include a line about what "P2P" means). @Adi and @Djordje did this very well in the previous presentation day, as did @Sanchayan Ghosh and @sak .
Keep it simple. Simple concepts, and simple demo.
Rehearse it (timed at 10 minutez) with your team lead and incorporate feedback before Saturday.


a suggestion for the format of slides:

Introduce live interfaces (perhaps using P2P diagram) without needing any context
Show how your idea fits the pattern in a very simple slide.
Visual/interactive demo exemplifying the above
A short list of your future hopes

These could be done in 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 minutes (resp).

It's okay if it's repetitive across demos. Better, even.

If your slide number 2 above is simple, that gives you leeway for demo to be a little complex.

Let's simplify even more. Here (above) are some design guidelines. Our presentation is supposed to be 7 minutes. Let's do it iteratively though.
